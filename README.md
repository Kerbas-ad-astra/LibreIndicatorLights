# LibreIndicatorLights

*Various helpful LED "indicators" to enhance your ships.  Based on the last MIT-licensed version of IndicatorLights by Snark.*

## Features

LIL basically has two things:

* **Standalone parts:** radially attachable LED lights with customizable colors, which can be toggled on/off with action groups.
* **Enhancements to existing parts:** add LEDs to stock parts to provide a visible, automatic indication of part status (such as whether a fuel cell is on or off).

For details (either as a player or as a modder), please see the **[IndicatorLights wiki](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/LibreIndicatorLights/wiki)**.

##Dependencies

LibreIndicatorLights depends on [**Module Manager**](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-105-module-manager-2613-november-9th-with-more-sha-and-less-bug-upgrade/).

##Download and install

Ordinarily, I'd direct you someplace to get a zip file to unzip into GameData, but IndicatorLights is still in active development.  If you really care enough to use LIL over IL, grab the source from [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/LibreIndicatorLights) and compile it with your favorite C# development tools, then plop the DLL and files in a "LibreIndicatorLights" folder in GameData.

##Version history and changelog

* 02016 Oct 11 -- Snark changes the IL license from MIT to CC-BY-NC-ND, inspiring the creation of LIL.

##Roadmap

Keep LCA up-to-date with KSP updates.  Make a snazzy logo.

A fully-compiled release will happen when Snark gets hit by a bus, and not before.

##Credits

Thanks are owed to Snark for creating IndicatorLights and inspiring LIL's existence.
